# Goal 1

Use React Router to render the pages. Link from Homepage to Registration.
URLs (pathnames):
```
/                         -> Homepage
/registration             -> Registration
/application/confirmation -> Confirmation
```
You will need an `App` component that will render the appropriate child component.
